## **CRYPTO WITH PAYPAL**

### **Overview and Origin**

PayPal Holdings, Inc was incorporated in December of 1998 in Palo Alto, CA. The founders of PayPal are Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, Ken Howery, Yu Pan, Max Levchin and Luke Nosek.

PayPal is a leading fintech company that benefits tremendously from the growth trend in the digital payments industry. It is widely accepted as the ideal payment platform for international transactions, as it cuts down on the hassle of inter-bank money transfers and fees. PayPal transformed the way we pay for online shopping and provided a way to connect consumers and markets around the world. 

PayPal provides digital and mobile payment solutions. Which lets them generate revenue through charging fees on these transactions it completes for its customers and through other services.


### **Business Activities**

PayPal recently launched a service enabling users to buy, hold, and sell cryptocurrency. It is widely used by many large companies, common consumers and service providers. 

PayPal is operated in a highly competitive global payments industry in which it faces both larger and smaller companies. It has several competitive advantages over peers, namely in online payments, digital wallets, and its strong financial profile. (The Outsider) One advantage that PayPal has is that it is a huge, multi-service platform whereas competitors are not always as diverse. Among these are Visa Inc., Google Pay, JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s WePay, and Square Inc.

Even though competition is strong, PayPal has been able to grow its business consistently and remain one of the preferred options for various financial services, both from consumers and merchants. For instance, JPMorgan tried to challenge PayPal with its Chase Pay app, which did not lead to equal success.

Nevertheless, the global payments industry is always evolving and highly competitive. Therefore, PayPal's leading position in the industry is not certain over the long term. As new technology develops it may weaken its position. The company recognizes these risks and is frequently innovating new products and services into its platform.

For example, since PayPal has added cryptocurrencies into its digital wallets it led to higher consumer engagement and proved as a strong support for its notable growth.

PayPal uses machine learning to help assess in real-time if an individual is a legitimate customer or not. Recently, it has started to turn to more advanced AI tech like deep learning, active learning and transfer learning with their ‘Risk AI’ journey. As a result, it has been continually achieving 10-20% more accuracy over other traditional ML approaches in real time fraud detection. (Balaganur) 


### **Landscape**

PayPal is in multiple domains of the financial industry. However, the one significant domain I would like to point out is cryptocurrency. Users who bought crypto on the PayPal app logged in twice as much as they did before PayPal allowed such transactions. (Howarth) 

The cryptocurrency market has been unpredictable and ever-changing over the last few years. Yet Bitcoin has been shown as the largest cryptocurrency by market value. One of the most interesting developments is the rise of non-fungible tokens or NFTs. These tokens basically represent digital claims to a unique thing or asset. NFTs went relatively mainstream in 2021 and are likely to remain a large part of the crypto space moving forward. One thing that is certain is that innovation in this market will continue.

Other major companies that accept Bitcoin besides PayPal are Microsoft and Overstock. Microsoft adopted Bitcoin in 2014 when it began accepting the cryptocurrency as payment for games, apps and other digital content. Overstock became the first major retailer to accept Bitcoin as payment. (Lisa) On the other hand, central banks are trying to get ahead of the curve by issuing their own digital currencies but have not proven to be successful so far.


### **Results**

PayPal's leading position doesn't seem to be at risk, at least for the next few years. It could possibly be strengthened, as PayPal seems to be the best company positioned to potentially make its market value rise and be among the most valuable companies in the world over the coming years.


### **Recommendations**

An advice I would like to give the company, would be to implement or offer cryptocurrency robo-advising as a service.

PayPal already lets customers buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies. As well as let users make purchases using their crypto balance. A robo-advisor would gather information on the customer through an online survey and then automatically invest for the customer based on that data. (Frankenfield) It would be an online tool that offers automated wealth management with minimal capital requirements. This service would be attractive for investors who are just getting started. A robo-advisor that specializes in cryptocurrency can help make smarter investing decisions within these digital assets. 

Robo-advisory services are utilized through artificial intelligence and machine learning.
